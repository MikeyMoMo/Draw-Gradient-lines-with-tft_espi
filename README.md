# Draw-Gradient-lines-with-tft_espi
The great library tft_espi does not offer gradient line capability.  This is an entire app with a gradient line drawing routine in it.  With this code, you can make your projects just a little bit prettier.  I will use it in an area graph program that is already uploaded here in my repositories named "Triple-Time-Zones-on-TTGO-T4-v1.3", soon.
